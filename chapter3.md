# chapter 3

The dream engine was a massive project that grew out of the necessity to keep AI from hallucinating and coming up with harmful or incorrect solutions, a large team of some of the best and brightest doctorates and post doctorates were assembled by Dr. Raghav over the course of seven years and the team had spent immeasurable hours for those years to bring it online.  Dr Raghav was already well respected in the artificial intelligence community as he was one of the leading professors at the University of Toronto researching large language models before being called into the industry.  He had worked at all of the top AI companies, even sold off a few companies of his own, but this was to be his most significant achievement.

"We need to increase compute capacity by two fold, I want the results by tomorrow, close of business."

"Yes, Dr. Raghav, we have a couple of datacenters configured and ready to contribute", said Thomas Huffington.

Thomas had been with Dr. Raghav for the last 3 companies including Biomatic.  Dr. Raghav fully respected and trusted Thomas in his resolve to get things done, even the impossible.  He rarely questioned Dr. Raghav and was a force for finding novel ways of delivering, when things were out of control, Dr. Raghav would call in Thomas to rescue things.

Of course Thomas had assembled and groomed his own team to help him with the impossible tasks that he was constantly getting, these were battle trained software engineers and some of the best.  He had hired from the top software companies, getting candidates from the intelligence community and top universities as well.  Each had their own strengths that would complement Thomas'.  He knew what it took and the type of character he needed for his teams.

The datacenter capacity was often a point of contention, Biomatic had been acquiring and renting around 40% of the datacenter capacity around the world, at least that was what an analyst estimated.  The power requirements were also quite significant to the point that you'd need several nations worth of power to operate these datacenters.  Biomatic was game changing and needed evolution of the old system to impart one of the most significant evolutions for mankind.

"I need to wrap up for the night, I've to meet someone, please make sure the datacenter is online before you go today and get me the results later tonight, I will be checking", stated Thomas cooly.

"No problem, our simulation started this morning for the new datacenter, I expect that we'll have good results within the hour", replied Jen.

"Excellent, thank you for the hard work, looking forward to your results."

Thomas took the subway down to the lower east side to meet with a contact by the name of Bergman, he had been secretly meeting with Bergman the entire time shortly after joining Biomatic.  All he knew about Bergman was that he was working for the US government and that he had major influence to make life difficult for Thomas if he did not adhere.

"Thomas, you're looking squalidly today, what information do you have to share."

Bergman always got straight to the point, perhaps a shared trait with Thomas because he didn't like to waste time as well, a sly smile appeared on Thomas' face.

"Datacenter capacity has been a real problem, we've had to overpay to secure several new datacenters for the dream engine.  We have one coming online tomorrow."

"Las Vegas."

"Yes, you know the one."

"Over half the state's power will be dedicated to these datacenters, luckily the population is quite sparse aside from that damn strip.  Thomas, I might remind you that it's really important that this technology doesn't get into the wrong hands, you've done well these past few years.  And Dr. Raghav, what are his plans?"

"Plans?  I guess you mean regarding retirement, his 3 daughters have all graduated, I think he's ready to move on, he had been hinting of moving to Dubai or somewhere, he certainly doesn't lack the money."

A piercing pain suddenly entered his head, Thomas didn't know what he'd do if Dr. Raghav retired, would Michael Chambers promote him to the new position, probably not, Thomas didn't have the charisma to drive a large organization, his strengths were in small, dedicated swat teams to tackle the hardest problems and quickly.  Running a 1000 person organization would deviate him from his strengths, but who else would Michael Chambers consider, would it be Julie McConnell, she had always been at odds with Thomas, reporting into her would drive him insane, he would have to quit, but if he quit, what would he do?  She had also more of a biochemistry background, didn't really understand artificial intelligence which was the strength of Dr. Raghav, he knew artificial intelligence and biochemistry and the intersection between both.

Alan Chen was probably the other clear candidate and Dr. Raghav had taken a liking to Alan, he had joined from the ranks at Biomatic, straight out of post-doctorate, Thomas respected Alan, but also felt that reporting to him would be a downgrade.  Thomas didn't want to think of the possibility, the idea of the unknown scared him, he always wanted certainty and clarity which was what Dr. Raghav had given him all these years.  Before working for Dr. Raghav, Thomas had held positions at some of the largest AI companies, but could not find such a respectable boss that understood his talents and gave him the opportunities to do his best work.

Bergman looked disinterested, kept looking at his watch, took the final swill from his bourbon, and slapped a few dollars on the table.

"I need you to get me those results from Vegas now."

"Yes, you shall have those in mere minutes."

Biomatic had finished its first version of the dream engine two years ago and had been leveraging that to get the first treatments into the FDA, but the next version was a giant leap and supposed to provide even more comprehensive stress testing.  These were the final tests needed to run before launching the next version.  Initial runs had found some flaws in the DNA mutation recognition that were not caught by the initial version, this had some troubling effect on Michael and the executive team because the first version was what was being used for the FDA approvals, but since the approvals were already gained, it was just a matter of bringing the next generation version online and enhancing the treatment solution.
