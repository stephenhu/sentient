# chapter 5

Arriving in the state of Arizona, Evangeline started to think back to her younger days when her dad would take the family on road trips while he had the summers off from teaching, Arizona was never one of the places she visited together with her dad, this was her first time to the state, but the sense of adventure and the unknown in front of her scared her yet at the same time excited her.  ph3r0nix hadn't made contact with her following their last correspondence, she would glance at her phone constantly expecting the next message to come, why hadn't ph3r0nix responded, did she go to Phoenix for no reason?  She still had a couple hours of driving before getting to Phoenix and was deciding on whether to stay in her car or get a hotel with a hot shower in Phoenix.

The roads in Arizona were flat, she had passed through Joshua Tree National Park down I-5 which was where the band U2 spent some time during their American Tour to come up with one of their best albums ever.  No cars were in sight, it was just her and her prius on the road.  This allowed her time to think, ph3r0nix, phoenix, that's too much of a coincidence, he can't be from phoenix, that's too obvious, hackers were never obvious, intentionally difficult to comprehend, purposely confusing.  If he's not from Phoenix, where is he from?  Is he even a he?

Suddenly a message appeared from ph3r0nix, but it wasn't a text message, but rather an audio message, which he never sent before.  She gazed ahead at the traffic, miles of road going straight, so she glanced at her phone again and played the message, there was a distorted voice to cover up his/her identity.

"Hopefully you're close to Phoenix, we need to be absolutely careful, make sure you're not being followed, we can not meet longer than 5 minutes, I will explain as much as I can to you, but for your safety, put the timer on 5 minutes and get out of there quickly after that.  The address is for a diner, sit at the booth closest to the restrooms, order coffee and hashbrowns and I will be there shortly."

Evangeline decided to drive directly to the diner, have a late dinner, relax from her long drive and then stay at a motel close by.  Upon arriving finally at her destination, she noticed the diner was open 24/7 and had quite a few customers even at 25 past midnight.  She stood in the small parking lot and stretched out her back, she had been driving for the last 6 hours and was starting to ache.  Joe's Diner, open since 1923, must be a classic here in Phoenix on the outskirts of town.  How did ph3r0nix find this place, only locals must know this place.  She was convinced that ph3r0nix was from the Phoenix or surrounding area.  She locked her doors and went into the diner.  The diner looked like every other stereotypical diner, there were travellers, locals, and friendly wait staff chatting with all the customers.  In the back she could see a bald chef with cigarette in his mouth, the ashe of the cigarette still attached, he had a thick mustache, a sleaveless white tank top, and generally looked like he had been cooking in that greasy kitchen for the last 20 years.

She found the booth against the restroom, but there were people sitting in it, some high school jocks, the kind she hated, so she decided to sit further away from them, but within eye sight distance to observe in case ph3r0nix just happened to be there as well.  What would she do if tomorrow the booth was taken?

"What will you have, honey?"

"A nice big cup of orange juice, chef salad with chicken, and a slice of carrot cake would be perfect."

"Alright, honey, we'll get that over to you in just a moment.  You let me know if there's anything else you need."

The diner had a lot of strange looking people, the high schoolers were the only normal looking ones.  A motorcycle gang baldy with a large beard and clad in leather was chatting up with one of the waitresses, a few old men smoking, drinking coffee, and reading yesterday's paper.  The diner had a comfortable feel to it, the lights were warm, the food smelled good, and the conversations from the various tables were all part of the background noise that made everything feel so inviting.  In order not to stand out, she decided not to bring out her laptop and do work, but to just relax after a long day's drive and prepare mentally for tomorrow's meeting.

"Here you go, honey, you enjoy."

After finishing most of her food while in deep thought about what had just transpired over the last few days, the waitress came up to her with the check.

"You seem out in space somewhere kiddo, it must have been a long day."

"Yeah, uh, huh huh, I drove 11 hours to get here."

She suddenly realized that she had been offering up too much information and closed off.

"The carrot cake was excellent, you guys make great carrot cake."

"Where you from, 11 hours seems pretty far away."

Evangeline randomly thought up some other states within that radius, but decided that it was useless, her license plate says it all.

"I'm from California, the middle part of the state, coming to visit the University here."

She had added the middle part of California as part of her diversionary tactics, she was from the northern part of California, but this was the best she could come up with on a whim.  What did it matter, none of these people were suspect, but again she felt uncomfortable with lying and also divulging too much about herself.

"Well you have a good stay in Phoenix, that'll be $27.80."

Upon leaving the diner, Evangeline found the closest motel called the Pin-up 26, whatever that meant.  After getting into a room and hearing her obnoxiously loud neighbors, she decided that a warm bath was warranted before a good night's rest.  In the middle of her bath she thought about how strange it was for her to be in Phoenix, what she was doing here to begin with.  Was it a sense of adventure, was she just bored out of her mind or did she want closer comradery with her friends on the web?  What was wrong with her, was she being totally naive?  She had been off her computer for most of the day, which was atypical for her standards, but she didn't feel compelled to pick up her laptop surprisingly.  Computers had been her release where she could feel completely comfortable, she had full control and knew everything about them.  She was pondering what tomorrow would be like, what exactly ph3r0nix had discovered, was it even worth her coming all the way out here breaking the code to find out?  All these questions made her tired and she climbed into bed only to fall asleep within seconds.

The alarm sounded at 5:00pm, Evangeline wasn't much of a morning person and tended to go to bed very late in the twilight hours each day.  She felt groggy and discombobulated, where was she, was she in Berkeley or back home in Wellesley, MA?  What was she doing in a motel?  She had dreamed of her dad from what she could remember during her long slumber, she must have been sleeping for hours.  She dreamed about one of her summer trips with her dad, he was teaching her about the latest superscalar pipelines for modern CPUs.  She missed her dad, he had passed away from lung cancer a couple years ago and she was devastated, he didn't smoke, drink, had a healthy and active lifestyle, why did he have to go so quickly?

Evangeline checked her phone and saw no messages, she started to come to her senses and remembered her purpose for the trip and began to get prepared.

It was close to 11:15pm, Evangeline decided to go a bit early to make certain that she would get the booth closest to the bathroom.  The diner had a similar crowd as the night before, but there were a few more people, including this family with a couple of loud kids.  The booth by the bathroom was available, so she sat down, ordered hashbrowns and coffee.  The time seemed to pass slowly, 11:05pm, she started scanning inconspicuously across the diner for anyone that would resemble someone like her, but no one seemed to fit the bill.  At 11:08pm, coffee and hashbrowns were served, suddenly a man with a bushy head of hair approached her direction, she quickly glanced at her watch, it was 11:11pm, was this a bit early?  Was this ph3r0nix, he didn't look much like the presence that she had been corresponding with over the past few years, helping each other find ways to find the truth.  The man felt uncomfortable that she was eyeing him like she knew him or something and quickly walked past to get to the bathroom.  A sigh of relief came over her, why was she so on edge?  She took another sip of coffee, when she put the mug down, her phone lit up with a message and at the same time a small boy approached her, could this be the one, why was this kid out so late?

The boy had a box in his hand put it on the table and said, "This is for you, he asked me to check your phone."  He silently left the diner and disappeared.  

```
[23:16] ph3r0nix: Take this box, I couldn't make it in person and need to be away for awhile, do not show this to anyone just yet and b careful.  You should exit the diner as quickly as possible.
```

Evangeline was confused, why couldn't he be here, who was this messenger, did the messenger know ph3r0nix?  She came to her senses, quickly put the box in her bookbag, paid the bill and quickly left the diner returning to her motel room.  Inside the room, she locked the door and added the bolt lock for good measure.  A rush of fear came over her suddenly, what had she gotten herself into, what was in the box?  She closed all the curtains and took the box out of the bag, it was about the size of a large book, she opened it to find a black circuit board with the letters Sirus HXM3000 on it, she merely dropped the card in shock and fell to her knees in disbelief.
