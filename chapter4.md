# chapter 4

"How are the test results for next gen?"

_Next gen_ was the code name for the dream engine version two, a lot had been put into its development, Dr. Raghav was given an entirely separate team to rebuild the engine from the ground up to overachieve what version one could accomplish, the team working on the next gen included Thomas and many others, they were given free reign without any of the rigid timelines to get ready for FDA approval.  This was the uncompromised version that Dr. Raghav and Michael wanted to build from the start and with the additional funding from the first version's success, they were properly able to bring in all the heavy hitters necessary to fulfill the promise.

"We added another datacenter from Las Vegas which doubled our test capacity, the results are still not hitting our target, but we are at 89% which is an increase of 15%, I think one more round should get us through the finish line, I would add another two weeks."

Michael thought to himself, just 12 months ago, next gen couldn't even get to 2%, now they were close to the finish line and this would be a monumental upgrade from version one.

"I want you to keep me posted twice daily about progress, we're getting close and I want to be in the loop."

Michael also had been pushing back on talking to Dr. Raghav about his plans after the release of next gen, but he didn't want to distract him from closing out the project.  He knew that they had had their differences and that the stress had been wearing away at Dr. Raghav, so he wanted to make certain that they had this important discussion at some point.

"Rishi, our first version was already ground breaking, we changed the entire industry, but this will turn the entire industry upside yet again and with bigger impact, tell me what resources you need, I'll make sure you get them at whatever the cost.  This will really push the boundaries of what man can accomplish."

Only Michael called Dr. Raghav by his first name, Rishi, they respected each other over the years, but Michael sensed that he had driven Dr. Raghav to his limits to achieve next gen.

"Michael, I think that it's wonderful the position we're in with all the talent we've accumulated, this is our baby and we are this close to launching, you have been an incredible force in pushing me to achieve", stated Dr. Raghav while showing with his fingers how small of a distance there was left.

Dr. Raghav wondered also about bring up his retirement, but he had other things on his mind.

"You are aware of this, but next gen has found some inconsistencies with version one's mutation calculations, the results are off apparently by 0.12%, but that's enough to have rather large impact in terms of side effects.  I can only imagine what that will do in terms of our relationship with the FDA."

"Rishi, we are doing the right thing, there were limitations with the first version, even with those limitations, we are also seeing positive results, we are helping those cancer sufferers.  The next gen will only be better in helping us to identify new treatments."

"But Michael, the side effects are quite significant, we have to make certain that our treatments result in the utmost safety of our patients.  This is a fundamental order for what we're doing."

"Rishi, I understand where you're coming from, let's focus on finishing out next gen, we'll get through this, we always do."

Dr. Raghav nodded and left Michael's office to rejoin his team on the final push.  Retirement was in the back of his mind constantly, but he wanted to have this completed as his final act.  The anomalies were of concern to him and he had voiced this out many times to Michael and the rest of the executives, always getting pushed back.

It was a sunny day on Tuesday and Dr. Raghav took his lunch, a small turkey sandwich, out on the campus bench that he usually likes to sit and ponder on his own.  Everyone knew that he was a very hard working man and that these 15 minutes were his solace, so nobody bothered him during this time.  The air was fresh, the sun was out, he had finished all of his meetings for the day and just had to focus on the details of the project with the engineers.  He liked talking to the engineers, they often times spoke the same language and he loved to get lost in the technical details as opposed to working with the business teams or Michael.  Things were very binary for engineers, with business teams it was often multi-facted and complicated, he wasn't one for work politics and had achieved enough in his career that he didn't need to prove anything, so the fact that he could focus on the work at Biomatic was something that gave him deep satisfaction.

With his three daughters now on their feet, he thought back to everything he had accomplished, but felt that raising them was his biggest accomplishment in life.  He was so proud of them yet at the same time very anxious that he didn't get to spend enough time with them during their formative years.  His wife Subbha had been the backbone of the family and raised the 3 daughters mostly on her own.  Now with them moving on to graduate school or joining the workfoce, they would start to have their little lives and he'd probably be even further than he was while he was busy with all his work.

"Retirement is needed, I'd almost give up next gen to be with them more, but alas, there are only two weeks left."

Back at Berkeley campus, Evangeline was starting to worry, her access had been compromised to the Reston datacenter, she didn't collect any additional information and now access was blocked.  Her original access to the datacenter was through a resource working at the datacenter, usually access was leaked by unsuspecting employees accidentally opening up access by clicking on unsuspecting links which end up running a program and either capturing keyboard output and sending this outwards.  This company was good as they noticed the hole and plugged it up quickly, sometimes she would sit for weeks with unfettered access, but she was wise enough to know that good security teams would allow access only to monitor what activity was taking place by the hackers, hoping to trap them into doing something stupid.  Evangeline was experienced, she knew the typical patterns and wasn't going to fall for that.

Still no word from any of her contacts so she decided to focus on her project to hack a cluster together for large computations, she could do this from multiple pools of infected servers, but these were typically underpowered servers, she had gotten a taste of the power in the Reston datacenter and wanted more, but she had to find if there were other datacenters like that for now while things cooled off.

```
[11:16] SageWhisper: stay away from Reston, they know.
[11:16] DarkRemnant: everything ok?  let it cool off, we need another angle. still no details on Sirus.
```

Suddenly she received a message from a trusted source.

```
[11:18] ph3r0nix: I might have come up with some details, sage.  Need to find a safe haven to talk, in person.
[11:18] SageWhisper: this is against the code...
[11:20] ph3r0nix: i will send over the meeting location, there maybe trouble.
[11:20] SageWhisper: what trouble?
[11:21] ph3r0nix: i need to disconnect, just wait for my details...
```

A burst of adrenaline overtook Evageline, she had never, ever met any of her deep web crew, she didn't even know what they looked like or what gender they were, heck some of them could be young kids, but it was tempting to finally get to meet someone she had high respect for, but this broke the code, anonymity was critical, so to reach out in person and break the code must mean some really messed up situation.  ph3r0nix had helped her many times to gain access to various systems, he was one of the craftier hackers that could pretty much get access to anything, he had broken into the pentagon datacenter multiple times and come up with damning details on foreign operations and other classified information.  He or she was often times borderline obsessive with being able to hack into these systems, but sometimes didn't seem to have a purpose for breaking in other than for the challenge of it.  ph3r0nix, at least from her observations, never did anything shady, seemed to be quite aligned on doing good in the world, so she respected him for that.  Plus he had taught her a lot of skills for covering up tracks and different methods for breaking into systems.  He was like a mentor for her.  Evangeline imaged many things that could go wrong from this meeting, she would risk compromising herself, what if this is not the real ph3r0nix, what if he had been compromised and was merely out to get her?  This bothered her for many days and she lost sleep over it, but decided to move forward to meet.

Days passed and still no contact from ph3r0nix, she started to think that maybe something had gone wrong, she didn't even know where they'd meet, is he even in the same state or country for that matter?  How does he/she know where she was?  Then suddenly another message appeared.

```
[04:01] ph3r0nix: 85 Accomplish Way, Phoenix, AZ, 2d, 23:18
```

Phoenix was going to be an 11 hour drive, today was Wednesday so 2 days would be Friday.  Evangeline was excited, but at the same time petrified.

```
[04:06] SageWhisper: k
[04:06] ph3r0nix: more details coming later.  come alone and be careful.
```

She decided to reach out to DarkRemnant to confirm a few of her doubts and worries.

```
[04:27] SageWhisper: decided to meet with ph3r0nix, this is breaking the code, but I think something's up, not sure what, but it must be big.
[04:27] DarkRemanant: this is risky, are you sure you want to do this?  i've heard of hackers being used by the CIA to catch other hackers, the CIA would threaten to put them in jail if they didn't comply.  This sounds *too* risky.  Think things through.
[04:27] SageWhisper: not sure why this can't be conducted over the dark web, why is there a need to meet in person?
[04:27] DarkRemanant: we've known each other for many years, i don't recommend you meet with him even though ph3r0nix is always my boy, you are
also my boy so I'm going to tell you straight.
[04:28] SageWhisper: thanks dark, you are always my better half. will let you know.
```

She had already made up her mind and was going to go through with the details, she immediately headed home to plan out the itinerary and start packing.
