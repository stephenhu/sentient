# chapter 4

"How are the test results for next gen?"

_Next gen_ was the code name for the dream engine version two, a lot had been put into its development, Dr. Raghav was given an entirely separate team to rebuild the engine from the ground up to overachieve what version one could accomplish, the team working on the next gen included Thomas and many others, they were given free reign without any of the rigid timelines to get ready for FDA approval.  This was the uncompromised version that Dr. Raghav and Michael wanted to build from the start and with the additional funding from the first version's success, they were properly able to bring in all the heavy hitters necessary to fulfill the promise.

"We added another datacenter from Las Vegas which doubled our test capacity, the results are still not hitting our target, but we are at 89% which is an increase of 15%, I think one more round should get us through the finish line, I would add another two weeks."

Michael thought to himself, just 12 months ago, next gen couldn't even get to 2%, now they were close to the finish line and this would be a monumental upgrade from version one.

"I want you to keep me posted twice daily about progress, we're getting close and I want to be in the loop."

Michael also had been pushing back on talking to Dr. Raghav about his plans after the release of next gen, but he didn't want to distract him from closing out the project.  He knew that they had had their differences and that the stress had been wearing away at Dr. Raghav, so he wanted to make certain that they had this important discussion at some point.

"Rishi, our first version was already ground breaking, we changed the entire industry, but this will turn the entire industry upside yet again and with bigger impact, tell me what resources you need, I'll make sure you get them at whatever the cost.  This will really push the boundaries of what man can accomplish."

Only Michael called Dr. Raghav by his first name, Rishi, they respected each other over the years, but Michael sensed that he had driven Dr. Raghav to his limits to achieve next gen.

"Michael, I think that it's wonderful the position we're in with all the talent we've accumulated, this is our baby and we are this close to launching, you have been an incredible force in pushing me to achieve", stated Dr. Raghav while showing with his fingers how small of a distance there was left.

Dr. Raghav wondered also about bring up his retirement, but he had other things on his mind.

"You are aware of this, but next gen has found some inconsistencies with version one's mutation calculations, the results are off apparently by 0.12%, but that's enough to have rather large impact in terms of side effects.  I can only imagine what that will do in terms of our relationship with the FDA."

"Rishi, we are doing the right thing, there were limitations with the first version, even with those limitations, we are also seeing positive results, we are helping those cancer sufferers.  The next gen will only be better in helping us to identifying new treatments."

"But Michael, the side effects are quite significant, we have to make certain that our treatments result in the utmost safety of our patients.  This is a fundamental order for what we're doing."

"Rishi, I understand where you're coming from, let's focus on finishing out next gen, we'll get through this, we always do."

Dr. Raghav nodded and left Michael's office to rejoin his team on the final push.  Retirement was in the back of his mind constantly, but he wanted to have this completed as his final act.  The anomalies were of concern to him and he had voiced this out many times to Michael and the rest of the executives, always getting pushed back.

It was a sunny day on Tuesday and Dr. Raghav took his lunch, a small turkey sandwich, out on the campus bench that he usually likes to sit and ponder on his own.  Everyone knew that he was a very hard working man and that these 15 minutes were his solace, so nobody bothered him during this time.  The air was fresh, the sun was out, he had finished all of his meetings for the day and just had to focus on the details of the project with the engineers.  He liked talking to the engineers, they often times spoke the same language and he loved to get lost in the technical details as opposed to working with the business teams or Michael.  Things were very binary for engineers, with business teams it was often multi-facted and complicated, he wasn't one for work politics and had achieved enough in his career that he didn't need to prove anything, so the fact that he could focus on the work at Biomatic was something that gave him deep satisfaction.

With his three daughters now on their feet, he thought back to everything he had accomplished, but felt that raising them was his biggest accomplishment in life.  He was so proud of them yet at the same time very anxious that he didn't get to spend enough time with them during their formative years.  His wife Subbha had been the backbone of the family and raised the 3 daughters mostly on her own.  Now with them moving on to graduate school or joining the workfoce, they would start to have their little lives and he'd probably be even further than he was while he was busy with all his work.

"Retirement is needed, I'd almost give up next gen to be with them more, but alas, there are only two weeks left."
