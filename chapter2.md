# Chapter 2

The rain had been heavy today, pelting her car roof like bullets and seemed to have no end, it never rains in California so there was some level of comfort in the pitter patter sounds even though she got soaked running from the lab to the car.  Evangeline was curled up in the backseat with her knees propped up against the back of the front seat.  The familiar blue glow emanating from her laptop like a digital shower as she was continuously investigating the details of the data that she had pulled earlier and was shocked to find millions of servers with hardware that she had never even heard of, Sirus HXM3000, what exactly was that?  In her call out to friends on the dark web for any knowledge of Sirus or the model number HXM3000, no one had heard of it before, Evangeline had always sought comfort in the friends she found on the dark web though she never met any of them in person, that was part of the code of the dark web's inhabitants, anonymity and safety through anonimity, but the people she found were some of the most trustful and helpful people despite their disposition of working in the shadows--hacking was a lifestyle, a full time profession and you could either use it for good, for a cause, or do some real damage to the world.  She always knew this and struggled at times to decide which side to support like most other skillful hackers who had the power and information literally at their fingertips.

[23:04] SageWhisper: found this incredible score, can't believe how much hw there is, ne heard of "Sirus"? :P  model # HXM3000
[23:04] Basaic: never!
[23:05] DarkRemnant: hey sage :) i haven't heard let me check my sources
[23:05] SageWhisper: owe u one dr!
```

Her hair and clothes were still wet, patience wsn't her strong suit so decided to run to her car without an umbrella, sacrificing her trusty laptop. To Evangeline it was like a shield that had helped her cope with life, she could only find solace in her laptop and she had many of them, kind of like a collection of books where each one served a certain purpose.

After arriving home, getting some warm food and a hot bath, Evangeline was back at it again:

```
[02:12] DarkRemnant: this odd nobody knows, checked everywhere and this is buggin me out.  i might need to go ask kermit.
[02:35] SageWhisper: sg dr, gm.
```

Evangeline had already finished a script that would crawl the servers for any additional clues, the systems were impeccable and had left almost no trace of what data they were processing, but she could tell from the utilization that the servers were extremely busy, hat were they processing?  Who or what is Sirus?  This type of specialized hardware was truly unique and piqued her curiosity, but she had a sense that she was playing with fire, not that she hadn't done this before.  She had been in several group hacks to take down bad corporations, exposed maligned politicians, and even ventured into going after criminal organizations, there were repercussions going against criminals, so she tended to stay away from those cases, but every now and then, the cause justified the means.  She also knew that there was a small window to collect more information before someone started to notice, so she wanted to finish the code before sun up.

Michael returned home after a long night out with friends, slightly buzzed and with comfortable smile on his face, he bid Ms. Miles goodnight, gave her a hug, and then descended to his room without saying a word.

"You look happy, a very good night to you, sir", she replied.

The night view of the city with all the neon lights and skyscrappers made him feel safe, like there was always something going on and that he lived in the most modern of cities.  Michael was always afraid of boredom, having complete darkness, quiet, and peace made him extremely uncomfortable.  During drinks he met with some old friends that he had since elementary school at a nice, quiet speakeaasy with leather chairs, dark and quiet atmosphere, and the occassional cigar smoke.  He liked quiet bars where he could talk and conversate as opposed to the loud, obnoxious clubs, for Michael it was always about intellectual curiousity and exploring something new with each conversation, that's why he particularly enjoyed time spent with Jeremaih Crantz.  Jeramiah had been a part of the Olympic Math Club in middle school and they always competed on getting first prize oscillating back and forth, Jeramiah would go on to work as a quantitive analyst and then open up his own hedge fund.  The two had kept fairly in touch even though Jermiah was always on the east coast while they went to university.  There was something familiar with Jeremiah, perhaps it was that shared understanding of some of the most difficult math problems that gave them a common sense of comfort knowing that there was someone that could relate.  The other friend was Jacob Miller which was more quiet and subdued than Jeramaih, but Michael felt he could always speak his mind to these two.

"A congratulations are in order, Michael, you have achieved something for all of mankind!  I am happy and envious of your success!", said Jeremiah.

"So this will eliminate all types of cancer?", inquired Jacob.

"Yes, cancer does not discriminate whether it's in the lungs or stomach, it's all cancer, just certain organs are more painful and the effects are more critical than others.", responded Michael.

"AI is incredible, cancer just seemed like an opportunity cost where it didn't seem effective to find a cure, it's such a big business, I wonder what all the cancer treatment companies will do now that they will probably go bankrupt."

"I have seen many patients going through radiation therapy and chemotherapy, it's one of the most painful ways to live, your quality of life immediately goes to zero or even negative if possible, not just the hair loss, but those chemicals kill everything inside of you, the good and the bad, you are left wretched and miserable, and the efficacy of these therapies is not guaranteed, I guess it depends on the stage that the cancer was detected.  Anyway, with our AI, we were able to quickly and cost effectively find the cure, putting those companies out of business will be done with pleasure!"

Michael didn't have any immediate family members with cancer, but he knew of people that had impacted members, Kate's father had pancreatic cancer which is probably the worst of them all, she didn't mention it much, but he remembered the look in her eyes as she told him for the first time, never again to mention it.

"From my understanding, your dream engine is able to stress test any therapies generated by AI and reviewed by human researchers, but this was created by a human to verify something half man, half machine created, there are trillions of combinations, how can you be sure that the solution is absolutely correct, that must be a daunting task to check the integrity of the data?"

"That's where we build on that solid foundation, stress testing, as you call it, and meld with the physical world by testing through clinical trials, first with mice, then monkeys, and lastly with humans.  Besides, the results are astonishing, none of the current therapies give such a high level of success, this is much, much better and safer by multitudes of factors by what's out there today.  Besides, there's no hair loss, effective in late stages as well, and we don't see any side effects."

"I get it, I really do, but I am truly astonished that we are trusting a large portion of AI calculated solutions to deliver this, what if AI had its own agenda and placed some sort of back door to wipe out humanity?"

"Here you go again with your skynet theories, we control the algorithms, computers listen to us.  Let's have another round, gents!"
