# Chapter 1

Michael Chambers stood in his four story penthouse with hands over his hips triumphantly over looking Central Park on a Sunday morning.  He almost felt a sense of satisfaction, like sweet vindication for all his toils and struggles, things had finally come to a pinnacle in his early career, he had succeeded and made a name for himself where others could not.  A couple days earlier, Michael had delivered a press conference for his company, Biomatic, where he announced the end of Cancer.  Biomatic had found a way to provide injections that could cure cancer, clinical trials showed an effective rate of 79.2%, this was over a very long slog of 10 years with pivots, near death of the company, ousting of the original co-founders and board, and years of back and forth with the FDA and other government agencies, universities, and the scientific community at large.  Yet Michael still didn't feel total success, there was still something missing inside, he knew that there was still a long road to success and that the hard work would only now begin, but this was a massive step for mankind and that had always driven him to forge this path.

He finished off knotting his tie looking at the reflection in the window and then headed downstairs for breakfast before he'd head out for another set of events and press conferences, typically he didn't like press conferences, but he was ready and happy to spread the significant news, this was his first of many victory laps, he deserved it he told himself.  Ms. Miles greeted him with the usual cheerfulness, "Good morning, sir!  I have your coffee ready at the exact temperature you like and a delicious roast garlic sandwich you can take with you on the car.  I'll have Samuel bring the car around and Mrs. Osterman is in the lobby waiting, she wanted to come up, but I told her that you'd be right down, that lady is too much, sir!"

Michael cheerfully responded, "Thank you, Ms. Miles, yes, I'll take the sandwich and coffee to go, you did the right thing, Mrs. Osterman is super aggressive and pushy, but that's sometimes what I need in this life."

"And sir, I wanted to say that you are an incredible person, curing cancer is like a miracle!  My mother passed away, God bless, if only you had invented that earlier..."

Michael thought to himself while Ms. Miles continued talking, he always thought she talked too much and he didn't like the small talk, seemed that she was using this to gain favor in her role, but ironically, it was making him detest her more, but she had been with him for many years and he thought that he wasn't home frequently enough so it wasn't really a problem, plus he had bigger problems to solve and she just wasn't worth it.  So he grabbed the coffee and sandwich and quickly made way for the elevator.

Kate Osterman was Micheal's executive administrator, she organized everything for Michael, calendar, notes, presentation materials, what to wear, she was extremely detail oriented and over qualified in her role, she had a microbiology degree from MIT, but at Biomatic, she had one of the most important roles at the company outside of Michael because she was always around him.

"Good morning, Michael, you're looking quite dashing today.  I will prep you on today's agenda in the car, Samuel is waiting outside."

"Thanks Kate and good morning."

Kate and Michael got in the car and started going over the day's long itinerary.


Inside the UC Berkeley computer labs, Evangeline was munching on Cheetos banging away on her keyboard tirelessly searching for methods to access a high grade datacenter in Reston, VA.  She had been great with computers since having one at the age of 5, her father was a computer science professor and always had the latest and greatest computers that he'd bring home.  The green glow from the computer screen was particularly bright given that Evangeline liked the room to be pitch dark.  Late at night was the time she liked to work because there were fewer distractions and she could get into the zone where she could crank out typically ten times more productive code than normal, but the nights were too short, once the sun started to rise, she'd almost seemingly lose energy to write code.

"Voila, that's the angle that I was looking for!"

She had hacked into the datacenter where she was looking to find details on the hardware specifications, she had heard that this particular datacenter had some of the most sophisticated hardware in the world and she wanted to leverage some of that for some data crunching.  There was always a lot of reverse forensics that she had to do to clean up her tracks, this was an art, but luckily there were a lot of tools from the community on the web that provided just the right scripts to cover your tracks, getting caught would be a felony, but she had been doing it for a long time and had a knack for hacking.

Evangeline started to download the hardware details and was in parallel trying to figure out a way to use that hardware without being noticed.

"I started Biomatic 10 years ago with a couple of close college friends, Pete McKinney and Sarah Chang, at the time we wanted to merge our understanding of biology and computer science, specifically leverage artificial intelligence to find the most useful data and patterns to help speed up the process of saving lives and making the world healthier.  Using traditional methods and/or large teams of researchers, this process is slower by 100-200x, algorithms are the way to process these large data sets and quickly gain meaning.  Artificial intelligence is really good at taking large data sets, take a game such as Chinese go, a machine can calculate one hundred thousand combinations of moves in a few seconds while the top players in the world can probably get to two to three digits of combinations."

  Luckily we continued on that dream, Pete and Sarah had significant contributions and while those founders have since moved on, they are very much deserving of recognition as the rest of the Biomatic team."

Michael was not a great speaker, he didn't enjoy the process, he would rather spend time with _intellectuals_ that actually understood the inner details of how artificial intelligence could be used to crunch massive amounts of data and be taught to find interesting patterns to apply to the world of medicine.  However, he had enough practice where he was effective.  Wall Street had fully
