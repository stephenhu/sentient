Deep in the arctic, in the vicinity of the northern most part of Canada, was one of the world's largest sets of datacenters  being built out, almost a million square meters, some of these datacenters were even running under the ocean.  The cool temperatures required less cooling power, but even still, an enormous amount of power was required.  An old nuclear power plant was purchased fifteen years ago close by to the datacenters and had been rebuilt to purposely accommodate this workload.  Canada being a friendly nation, did not have many nuclear weapons and being that the population and power requirements were quite low, the location of the facility and why it was being rebuilt drew suspicioun, but Sanders Corp worked with all the politicians and filled their pockets with campaign dollars and cheap energy for the region so had been more or less operating without much intervention.  Sanders Corp was a private company that had absolutely no traces or mention anywhere, all that was known about the company was a business registration in the Cayman Islands under Ferris Johnson, the son of billionaire Edward Johnson who had made his fortune on Wall Street.  Edward Johnson passed away years ago and his son was just living the life of a billionaire cruising the world on his super yacht with super model girlfriends and throwing money at away at various casinos.

"Sir, we had some issues with the power sources for Regions M and TT, but those have been fixed, there was some interference from some whales in the area that caused the undersea cables to break.  We now have now installed webbing to keep those things away or at least provide some warning before they break."

Milton Sagerfield nodded.  He was a man of few words, but when he spoke, they were important and you had to listen keenly to get all the meaning out of it, he often spoke with highly packed sentences.  He was an efficient man, he didn't like the back and forth chatter and definitely wasn't one for small talk.  Milton was the serious type, Andrew Chen knew that he had to be very precise in his questions and absolutely flawless in his execution and answers.  Andrew had taken this job in the Arctic, but his young wife, Isabelle, and two young daughters were living in Bellevue, WA so he'd spend all his time at the site save for a trip per quarter back home.  This was one of the best jobs Andrew had ever had, his wife didn't work, so he was the breadwinner and could see working at Sanders for the next 20-30 years.  Reporting to Milton was highly lucrative for his career, while extremely challenging, he knew where he stood, what the expectations were, and how to get things resolved.  The system was perfect for him, he could do his job well and get promoted quickly over the years.  The pay was good, but he thought about how much time he was missing out of his two young daughters' lives and missed being able to have late night conversations with his wife.

Sanders Corp was a global corporation, from what Andrew knew of it, they had presence in many countries around the world, everything required government level like security clearance and he had worked for 5 years to get this level of access to work in the Arctic.  He had joined Sanders right after his stint with the US Marines where he was a support engineer and had a couple tours in Iraq.  For Sanders Corp, Andrew worked in Singapore before getting enough clearance to work in the Arctic location.

The datacenters were each considered their own region and labeled simply with the letters of the alphabet, Region A was the very first datacenter and followed up with combinations of two alphabet letters, AA, AB, AC, etc.  Within each datacenter, you could see for miles, rows and rows of state of the art server equipment.  The biggest issues for the Arctic site was getting parts, getting things shipped to the location took days, Sanders had its own private airspace and airport at the location and also there were ships coming in daily into Cape Egerton that had supplies for the employees like food, but also spare parts and machinery for the datacenters.  Andrew had worked with military datacenters in the past, but nothing quite like this.

Sanders was run very much like the military, so Andrew knew how to navigate, you do what you're told and you don't ask questions.  He had the feeling that Sanders was working with the US government because most of his colleagues were also from the armed services and they knew the protocol well.  However, in the back of Andrew's mind, he was always curious what these datacenters were used for, he was under strict legal agreements not to discuss the details with anyone, not even to his wife or friends.

These datacenters were considered above tier 4, no natural disaster risks, plenty of redundancy and fault tolerance built from the beginning, they could withstand nuclear explosions since they were built under ground, several hundred meters from the surface.  Typically tier 4 datacenters were the best in the world, but these were something above all else and in a class of their own.

There were times Andrew's wife would inquire about what he did in the Arctic, but he would tighten up, something in his mind would make him feel uneasy when she asked and he would close up, try to the change the topic, and just flat out tell her that he couldn't say, that he could get fired for telling.  This made Isabelle feel distant from Andrew, not only because he was physically away for practically the whole year, but she tolerated this because she didn't work and took care of the young children full time.  Taking care of Jennifer and Anna were a handful, luckily her mother was able to help around the house or she would have gone crazy long ago.  She had given up a career as a software developer many years ago and now Andrew was starting to have a stable career at Sanders, so she felt that she could focus on the children.

One more week and Andrew could fly back home to be with his family, that week seemed like an eternity, and when he returned, even though he was given two weeks reprieve, the time flew by so quickly that the next thing he knew, he was at the airport with wife and daughters crying to make him feel even more guilty.

Milton asked Andrew to come by his office later in the afternoon, he had some things to discuss with him.  Andrew was nervous about the meeting because of his upcoming reprieve, if the project was too challenging, he could risk having to postpone his trip back.  He glanced at his watch and then decided to hit the cafeteria before going his boss' office.

In the cafeteria, there weren't many people, everything at Sanders was done efficiently, meals were provided free of charge, but had to be completed within 20 minutes, seats were assigned each day with a one hour time slot.  It took some getting used to in the beginning, but as time grew, Andrew learned to appreciate the efficiency, eating was always such a process and often got in the way of getting things done.  Andrew sat down at table 31, there were two others at the table finishing up their meals.  Typically people didn't talk to each other other than the polite gesture.

"Hello, how are you?"

"Fine, thanks, another busy day."

"Well, I've got to be going, have a nice one."

Being in the middle of nowhere without even a town to go to made the experience extremely strange, there was a lack of companionship except for within your project teams and based on the schedule, there wasn't any time to really chat, the work was very focused and after you finished for the day, 
you just wanted to get back to your room and go to bed.

Andrew looked at his watch, it was 1:45pm and time to find Milton.  He left the cafeteria and went to Milton's office, Milton was easy to find, he was always either there or in the lab.  The strange thing about the Arctic site was that there were no meeting rooms, everyone had offices, some offices were shared, but absolutely no meeting rooms could be found.  He arrived at Milton's office and saw him typing away on his terminal.

"Come on in, Andrew, the reason why I asked you to come in today is the automation project, you are to talk to nobody about this project, walk with me, I'll fill you in on the details."

Milton swiftly got out of his chair, grabbed his vest and led Andrew out into the corridor, they walked for what must have felt like ten minutes before getting to the internal tram station.  The entire site consisted of various stations which were essentially living quarters for the employees which included rooms, cafeterias, gyms, and offices.  Each station serviced various regions of datacenters and there were a total of 122 stations.

"Andrew, we have been assigned the most important task yet, which is getting the automation plant ready for production, the previous two teams were not able to get this done.  The areas that we need to focus are on the 3D printing clusters and assembly clusters, we are expected to start right away and finish within 3 months, that means, of course, that you'll have to postpone your reprieve.  I hope you don't mind?"

Andrew was disappointed to hear his guess actually come to fruition, but at the same time, this was probably going to be the most challenging project he'd taken on at Sanders, this would automatically mean promotion which he'd be able to take on a role much like Milton's and he felt that he was ready for this, coupled with his service in the marines, he knew that he was ready for leadership.

"Of course, Milton, I'll need a moment to call my wife and tell her about the situation."

"Yes, you do that and then we'll start right away, there was a big shipment of materials at the cape."
